# densestSubgraph
Using the theory of densest subgraphs to predict the best keywords to summarize a text

Abstract

In this project, we transform the single-document keyword extraction
problem into the research of dense subgraphs, using the graph-of-word
representation of documents. After some preprocessing steps, a paper is
thus turned into a graph were each node represents a word, and edges
the links between them. We then apply different algorithms in order to
extract the densest subgraph, and we retain as keywords those in the
dense subgraph. Our results are compared to the existing approaches.
